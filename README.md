# ActivityListApp
  As a task of my internship, this is the second android app (using Java) I created.

## *Task 1: Develop an app that displays a list of items.*
  - Add a new activity in Android Studio for the list view.
  -  Design the layout with a ListView element.
  -  Populate the list with static data using an adapter.


## *Task 2: Build an app with multiple activities and a basic UI layout.*
  - Add more activities in the Android Studio project.
  - Design the layout for each activity using XML.
  - Arrange UI elements like buttons and text fields in the XML files.
